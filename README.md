#  Hi there! 👋 
I'm **Elena** — a detail oriented software tester who enjoys breaking things (on purpose) so users can have a smoother experience.

With a background in **IT** and hands-on skills in **manual testing**, **API validation**, and **bug reporting**, I'm passionate about ensuring software doesn't just work — it works well.

I test websites, APIs, and user flows by asking the "what if it breaks?" question — and then documenting exactly how (and why) it did.  
From login flows to checkout chaos, I'm on a mission to find bugs before users do.

🚀 This portfolio includes real-world test cases, bug reports, checklists, and testing strategies I’ve applied to demo apps and APIs.  
☕ Bonus: Most of these were tested under the influence of strong coffee and stronger curiosity.
